# Al-Quran

## Motivation

1. I use quran.com.
2. I want to navigate between verses through keyboard shortcuts, but they don't have that feature.
3. I tried making a user script, but failed because they used a virtualized list.
4. I wanted to make a fork and change it myself, but they say to not copy the project.
5. So I made my own.
